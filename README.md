# Neural-network-1

This project describes an hello-world example for neural network creation in Python.

The "main_nn_training" file is where the neural network is created, trained and the computed weights of the synapses are stored into files.
These files can be used to retrieve back weights without re-train the network. "main_nn_testing" retrieves back these weights and computes tests.

"nn_functions" includes a lot of function which are useful for the management of the dataset.


The dataset is based on handwritten digits from "sklearn.datasets.load_digits".

This project also includes a "main_base_example" where a neural network is trained to compute a XOR function.
